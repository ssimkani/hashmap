# HashMap

## Description

This is an implementation of the Hashmap data structure in Ruby as part of the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It is built using linked lists which are the elements of the hash map in order to resolve collisions. The Hashmap class includes methods for setting key-value pairs, retrieving values, and determining if a key is included in the Hashmap.

## What I learned

- How to use Hashmaps to store key-value pairs and linked lists to resolve collisions
- Ways to incorporate Hashmaps to solve problems more efficiently
- How to use hash and rehashing methods to reduce collisions
