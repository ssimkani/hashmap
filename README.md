# HashMap

## Description

This is an implementation of the Hashmap data structure in Ruby as part of the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It is built using linked lists which are the elements of the hash map in order to resolve collisions. There are methods for setting key-value pairs, retrieving values, and determining if a key is included in the hash map.
